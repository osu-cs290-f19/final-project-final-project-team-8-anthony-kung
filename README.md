SCMS is designed to help KidSpirit OSU in the digital management of their campers. It provides them a tool to quickly identify a camper, get immediate help, locate a nearby responder, process payment and more.

The Summer Camp Management System uses PWA Technology to serve on mobile devices. PWA technology ensures that most features of the system are available offline through service workers. PWA allows the user to use SCMS similar to a native mobile app.

SCMS adapts NFC (Google Chrome Beta required) and Face Recognition to quickly identify the camper and their emergency information should there be an emergency. There is also a geolocation system to function as an emergency beacon for quick navigation to emergency responders and supervisors. It also constantly displays a map with beacons of registered emergency responders.

The SCMS also incorporated a mobile payment system (mPOS) powered by Stripe API. This allows the camp staff to process payment anytime anywhere. The SCMS is encrypted with TLS 1.2 protocol and complies with PCI DSS v3.2 to provide maximum security.

To facilitate communication, the SCMS also includes a built-in push-to-talk voice communication system. This allows camp staff to use it as a walkie talkie with no range limit (via the internet).
